# fast-slideshow
A tiny wordpress slideshow plugin that won't slow down your site. 

Uses [Lory](https://github.com/meandmax/lory), a 7kb touch enabled minimalistic slider written in vanilla JavaScript.

 - Provides a [fast-slideshow] shortcode that will display all images attached to a post in a simple slideshow. 
 - Simple admin screen to let you quickly opt-out of loading Javascript and Css files should you want to include them in your theme.
 - By default, Javascript and Css files are only loaded on full-text pages/posts that contain the shortcode, but not on any listings, such as the blog posts page or category pages.
 - No dependencies. No need for jQuery.
